# JoBot
This is a Telegram ChatBot for my DSSS class at FAU.

### To Do:
To start JoBot, the Before running main.py or using the jobot.sh to run JoBot, the APIs of the Telegram Bot and the server where TinyLlama is running, have to be given!

Create Python file config.py and enter the APIs as follows:

```
TELEGRAM_API = ""
LOCAL_SERVER_API = ""
```

main.py then imports the APIs.
